  Provides primitives to allocate and free memory buffers of various memory types and alignments.

  The Phase Memory Allocation Library abstracts primitive memory allocation operations. This library
  allows code to be written in a phase-independent manner because the allocation of memory in PEI, DXE,
  and SMM (for example) is done via a different mechanism. Using a common library interface makes it
  much easier to port algorithms from phase to phase.

/**
  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of a certain memory type and returns a pointer
  to the allocated buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.

  @param  Type                  The type of allocation to perform.
  @param  MemoryType            The type of memory to allocate.
  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to allocate.
  @param  Memory                The pointer to a physical address. On input, the
                                way in which the address is used depends on the
                                value of Type.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The requested pages were allocated.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The pages could not be allocated.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The requested pages could not be found.

  Frees one or more 4KB pages that were previously allocated with one of the page allocation

  Allocates a buffer of a certain pool type.

  returned.  If there is not enough memory remaining to satisfy the request, then NULL is returned.

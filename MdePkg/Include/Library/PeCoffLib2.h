/** @file
  Provides APIs to inspect, load, and relocate PE/COFF Images.

  No implementation of this library may use global variable pointers, as this
  may cause the emission of Image relocations for this address. This is
  incompatible with the concept of Image self-relocation, where the Image is
  loaded in a similar fashion to XIP Images into the memory at an address
  unknown at compile-time. As such, Image relocation must be safe to perform
  without any Image relocations applied earlier.

/** @file
  Provides extended services to allocate and free memory buffers of various memory types and alignments.
  This header is part of the MemoryAllocationLib library class. Every instance
  of MemoryAllocationLib must also implement the functions declared by this
  header. The separation is due to the newly-introduced dependency on
  MdePkg/Uefi/UefiSpec.h.

/**
  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of a certain memory type and returns a pointer
  to the allocated buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.

  @param  Type                  The type of allocation to perform.
  @param  MemoryType            The type of memory to allocate.
  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to allocate.
  @param  Memory                The pointer to a physical address. On input, the
                                way in which the address is used depends on the
                                value of Type.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The requested pages were allocated.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  The pages could not be allocated.
  @retval EFI_NOT_FOUND         The requested pages could not be found.

  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type at a specified alignment.

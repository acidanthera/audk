  #
  # For security and code size optimization reasons, the UefiImageLib design is
  # complicated. To not expose FV-only UEFI image formats via, e.g., DxeCore to
  # untrusted sources, UefiImageLib can be configured to support different UEFI
  # image formats per source. While compilers generally manage to optimize the
  # initial parsing steps, complex control flow can make them lose track of the
  # UefiImageLib source property and thus conditionally call into code for UEFI
  # image formats that are not required by the module at all (e.g., because it
  # only ever deals with FV images).
  #
  # To have the code for unsupported UEFI image file formats removed,
  # UefiImageLib comes in multiple flavours that support FV-only, non-FV-only,
  # or all UEFI image formats. These flavours are supposed to be used by
  # top-level modules that have a clear scope. As libraries may depend on
  # UefiImageLib too, however, they should consume the general UefiImageLib with
  # no clear flavour.
  #
  # If they consume libraries with UefiImageLib dependencies, modules must have
  # their general UefiImageLib set to their corresponding flavour for correct
  # linkage. In order to make this easier, there is a heuristic below, based on
  # module types, to set the most likely instance of UefiImageLib. In rare
  # cases, manual overriding in the platform DSC may be necessary.

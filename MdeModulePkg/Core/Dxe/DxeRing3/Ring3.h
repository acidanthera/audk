                                string, optionally followed by additional binary data.
                                The string is a description that the caller may use to further
                                indicate the reason for the system reset.
                                For a ResetType of EfiResetPlatformSpecific the data buffer
                                also starts with a Null-terminated string that is followed
                                by an EFI_GUID that describes the specific type of reset to perform.

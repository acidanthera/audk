/**
  Allocates one or more 4KB pages of a certain memory type.

  Allocates the number of 4KB pages of a certain memory type and returns a pointer
  to the allocated buffer.  The buffer returned is aligned on a 4KB boundary.

  @param  Type                  The type of allocation to perform.
  @param  MemoryType            The type of memory to allocate.
  @param  Pages                 The number of 4 KB pages to allocate.
  @param  Memory                The pointer to a physical address. On input, the
                                way in which the address is used depends on the
                                value of Type.

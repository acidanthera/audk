/** When using FF-A ABI, there're ways to request service to StandaloneMm
      - FF-A with MmCommunication protocol.
      - FF-A service with each specification.
   MmCommunication Protocol can use FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ or REQ2,
   Other FF-A services should use FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ2.
   In case of FF-A with MmCommunication protocol via FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ,
   register x3 saves Communication Buffer with gEfiMmCommunication2ProtocolGuid.
   In case of FF-A with MmCommunication protocol via FFA_MSG_SEND_DIRECT_REQ2,
   register x2/x3 save gEfiMmCommunication2ProtocolGuid and
   register x4 saves Communication Buffer with Service Guid.

   Other FF-A services (ServiceTypeMisc) delivers register values according to
   there own service specification.
   That means it doesn't use MmCommunication Buffer with MmCommunication Header
   format.
   (i.e) Tpm service via FF-A or Firmware Update service via FF-A.
   To support latter services by StandaloneMm, it defines SERVICE_TYPE_MISC.
   So that StandaloneMmEntryPointCore.c generates MmCommunication Header
   with delivered register values to dispatch service provided StandaloneMmCore.
   So that service handler can get proper information from delivered register.

   In case of SPM_MM Abi, it only supports MmCommunication service.

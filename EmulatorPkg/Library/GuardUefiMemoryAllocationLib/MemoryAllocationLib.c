/** @file
  Support routines for memory allocation routines based
  on boot services for Dxe phase drivers using OS malloc.

  OS malloc is used so OS based malloc debugging tools can be used.
  If a single driver links against this lib protocols from other
  drivers, or EFI boot services can return a buffer that needs to
  freed using the EFI scheme. This is why the gEmuThunk->Free ()
  can detect if the memory rang is for EFI so the right free can be
  called.
